This is the GitHub repo for a series I am doing on YouTube: MEAN Stack Basics. You can find it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ9fTNDpvpl50uZ3mL42yJv3dUr9x5HPQ">here</a>.

I will update the master branch each episode. Also, I will create branches for each episode, so you can get the code for a specific episode.
